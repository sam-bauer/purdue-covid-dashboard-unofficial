## Inspiration
As a student at Purdue University, I found it difficult to understand the COVID-19 data that was being shared on the official university website. The data was presented in a confusing manner and it was hard to grasp the overall picture of the situation on campus. This inspired me to create a more user-friendly visualization of the data, to make it easier for students and parents to understand. I wanted to create a tool that would help people stay informed and make better decisions in regards to their health and safety during the pandemic.
